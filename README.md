This a database driven website created for CS257 (Software Design) at Carleton College.
It was made by me and my group mates: Isaac Lund, Ryan Dusaire, and Stefan Li.

If you'd like to run it, you'll have to create the postgres database, but if you'd
just like to view the end result, take a look at the Demo folder for some images
of the finished product.
