# Team Contract Requirements

The team contract helps build group cohesion and accountability, removes much of the cognitive
load in keeping track of tasks, responsibilities, and deadlines, and gives teams the opportunity
and space to reflect on their individual and team goals and expectations.
In your team contract, you should address the following prompts:

1. **What are the goals of our team?** What do you, as a team, want to gain from this
    project experience? What goals and skills do you want to attain and/or hone? Start your
    contract with a **goals statement**.
Our goals:

We want to develop skills in front-end and back-end development that we could apply to a future
career in software development. More specifically, learning to use SQL, javascript and HTML, as
well as getting them to talk to one another using python flask. We want to improve our skills
working collaboratively on code and working with version control (GitHub).

2. **What are the strengths of our team and its members?** Individually, think about the
strengths you bring to the project. These could include technical strengths (“I am really
good at finding bugs in code”, “I organize my code really well”, “I can find answers very
efficiently by searching”) and broader life skills strengths (“I take excellent notes”, “I am
an excellent listener”, “I like to find and build consensus when there’s disagreement”). If
you already know some of your teammates and/or have worked with them previously,
feel free to add to their strengths. **List these out for each team member in your
contract.**

Aidan: Lots of experience in computer science since I’m so old. More general experience in
college and know how to succeed, not just in a computer science setting.
Isaac: Has worked a lot with GitHub. Good communicator and solid brainstormer (I’d like to
think). Pretty good at finding error solution on the internet when necessary (stackexchange)
Ryan: General experience in many programming languages, organized, good at working in
groups, and love solving problems.
Stefan: Worked a lot with UI/UX design. Experience with figma for frontend prototyping.

How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?** Think about your team goals and
how each person might contribute to achieving them based on their strengths. Does assigning
roles make sense for your team, or perhaps rotating roles? Note that exact roles and
responsibilities will likely change over the lifetime of this project, and that’s ok. Is someone in
charge of setting meetings? Two people focused on reviewing code or testing?

3. **What are the expectations that will guide our team?** Specifically:

a. Meetings **:** When will your team meet? What time, how often, for how long,
where?

We will of course meet in class during the allotted groupwork times, and once things start
ramping up, we’ll meet 2-3 times outside of class. Wednesday 3:30-5:30, Friday (anytime after
lunch), Sundays (before 5)

b. Roles: What roles will members take on in your meetings? How often will you
rotate roles? Who is responsible for setting agendas, taking notes, facilitating
discussions, etc?

We’ll rotate roles every meeting (scribe, leader, planner, mutual communicator). This looks like a
cop-out, but it will really work I swear.

c. Communication:

i. How will you communicate with each other? (to share work, to ask
questions, notify the group if someone is running late or if someone will
miss a meeting, etc)
Text group chat.

ii. How will you make sure communication stays respectful? How does your
team define “respectful”?

We will entertain everyone’s ideas and never put someone down for a less productive
suggestion. Respect means meeting people where they’re at without judgement.

iii. What are the expectations for dealing with a teammate who hasn’t been
communicating? How frequently should team members communicate /
check in?

Talk to them in class and don’t get in their face; ask them why they aren’t communicating and try
to come to an agreeable solution.

d. Technologies: What technologies will you use to support team meetings and
work? (Google Drive, Hangouts, Zoom, Facetime, etc)

Text, drive, github, FaceTime/Zoom if we really can’t meet in person

e. Decision-Making: How will you make decisions? (Unanimous, consensus,
majority rule, by assigned roles, rock-paper-scissors, etc.)

Majority rule. This way we don’t get stuck if one person (any of us 4) is dissatisfied

f. Delegation:
i. How will you divide the work?

Once we know the project better we will divide up work the work evenly. What we
_won’t_ do is giving someone backend, someone frontend, etc, because those
pieces will be completed at different times during the term and we don’t want
members to have chunks of time where they work a ton and other times when
they’re not doing anything at all—very inefficient!

ii. How will you ensure that everybody participates meaningfully? How will
you make sure that everyone’s contribution is valued?

We can ensure everyone’s contribution is valued by assigning meaningful 
work, if the work isn’t trivial, it has to be meaningful.

g. Conflict Resolution:

i. What expectations do you have for satisfactory participation? (e.g. time,
contributions)

Coming to every meeting that doesn’t conflict with other obligations, completing the part of the
work that you were given. Putting in work to debug code, especially if you wrote it, but also if
you didn’t and another teammate needs help. Staying with the pace of the rest of the group
when possible.

ii. What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their
responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?

Again, the first thing to do is to talk to them. If they continue to not do their part, maybe talking to
Jean about consequences.

iii. How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?

We will walk through issues step by step and analyze the pros and cons of the decision taken,
as well as assess alternatives for feasibility and improvements. Also, the disagreeing members
could each create a solution in their branch and we could compare them afterwards.
